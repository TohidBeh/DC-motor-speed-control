In this project, a DC motor was modeled and controlled through a combination of experimental system identification and classical controller design techniques. The goal was to identify the motor’s dynamic behavior and design a controller to regulate its rotational speed under varying operating conditions.

Experimental input–output data were collected from the motor by applying test signals and measuring the resulting speed response. Based on the observed behavior, a suitable transfer function model was estimated using system identification methods. The identified model was analyzed in both time and frequency domains to evaluate stability, transient response, and steady-state characteristics.

Using the identified model, a speed controller was designed and tuned to meet desired performance specifications, such as fast response, minimal overshoot, and zero steady-state error. Classical control techniques, including root-locus and frequency-domain analysis, were used to guide the controller design. The final closed-loop system was implemented and simulated in MATLAB and Simulink, and its performance was validated through step-response analysis.

This project strengthened practical skills in system identification, motor modeling, feedback control design, and performance evaluation for real-world electromechanical systems.
